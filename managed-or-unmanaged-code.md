# Managed or Unmanaged Code

## **Managed Code:-**

* The code, which is developed in .NET framework is known as **managed code**. 
* This code is directly executed by CLR with the help of **managed code** execution. 
* Any language that is written in .NET Framework is **managed code**.

## **Unmanaged Code:-** 

* The code, which is developed outside .NET framework is known as **unmanaged code**.
* Applications that do not run under the control of the CLR are said to be unmanaged, and certain languages such as C++ can be used to write such applications, which, for example, access low - level functions of the operating system. Background compatibility with the code of VB, ASP and COM are examples of unmanaged code.
* Unmanaged code can be unmanaged source code and unmanaged compile code. **Unmanaged code** is executed with the help of wrapper classes. 

**Wrapper classes are of two types:**

* CCW \(COM Callable Wrapper\).
* RCW \(Runtime Callable Wrapper\).
