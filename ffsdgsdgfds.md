# What is the garbage collector

* The garbage collector is a mechanism which identifies garbage on the managed heap and makes its memory available for reuse. 
* This eliminates the need for the programmer to manually delete objects which are no longer required for program execution. 
* This reuse of memory helps reduce the amount of total memory that a program needs to run. 
* In technical terms, we say that it keeps the program's “working set”  small.
