# Static keyword in C\#

**static** is a modifier in C\# which is applicable for the following:

1. [**Classes**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-class-and-object/)
2. [**Variables**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-variables/)
3. [**Methods**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-methods/)
4. [**Constructor**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-sharp-constructors/)
5. It is also applicable to [_properties_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-properties/), event, and [_operators_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-operators/). To create a static member\(class, variable, methods, constructor\), precede its declaration with the keyword _static_. When a member is declared static, it can be accessed with the name of its class directly.
