# Static Method and non-static method

## **1. Static Method:**

When ever we have to call static method/function,we don't need to create object or instantiating of that method and cant't use`new`keyword because when the class are load and compile then static keyword **by default** instantiate or create object of that class method, so that why we directly call static method.  
In reference of`static void main(args[])`as we had discuss about static remain`void Main`.`void`is data type which return nothing and`Main(args[])`is entry point to execution of program.

## **2. Non-Static Method:**

In this method we have to instantiating or creating object of class method to call the method/function of class using new keyword.`like`  
If a class name`Test`have **non-static** method and name`show()`,then how it would call an instantiating
